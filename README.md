### 🌐 HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

> HTML is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web.  

> It defines the structure of web pages using a system of elements and tags like `<head>`, `<body>`, `<div>`, `<p>`, and more.  

> HTML is not a programming language but a markup language that tells the browser how to display content.  

> The working process of HTML involves writing code in `.html` files, which the web browser reads and renders into visible and interactive web pages.  

> HTML works hand-in-hand with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to build complete, responsive websites.
